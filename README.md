## CryptoKet - NFT Marketplace
CryptoKet is made using the immense power of Solidity and Next.js. This project combines futuristic elements of Web3 blockchain development and the popular culture wave of non-fungible tokens (NFT). This application includes creation, buying, selling and reselling of NFTs and user authentication through metamask wallet. Its theme can be switched to both dark and light mode. Context API is used for state management and tailwind css is used for styling the application. Solidity is used to write smart contract and hardhat is used to test the smart contract.

## Specs
**Next.js**:
- It's a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
- Next.js is a frontend JavaScript framework built on React's UI library that is lightweight, server-rendered, and flexible. Developers typically use Next. js to build static, fully interactive sites and apps that are fast and easy to use.

**ESLint**
- ESLint is a configurable JavaScript linter. It helps you find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. Problems can be anything from potential runtime bugs, to not following best practices, to styling issues.

**TailwindCSS**
- It's a mordern utility first CSS framework packed with utility classes that can be composed to build any design directly in JSX code. It ables us to build modern website rapidly without even leaving HTML. It provides power and speed to our developmet process. In essence, it's different to other UI library like Bootstrap or Material UI.

**Dependencies**
- Hardhat: use to create, test and deploy our smart contracts - a smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally-relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.
- Open Zeppelin Contracts: provide us some utilities code to create our contract.
- Axios: is used to make APIs requests.
- Ethers: interact with blockchain's smart contracts from the client side.
- IPFS HTTP Client: allows us to actually deploy our NFTs
- Next Themes: a simple library allows us to switch between light and dark mode.
- React Dropzone: allow us to create components for uploading files.
- Web3 Modal: is another library for interacting with smart contracts on the client side.
